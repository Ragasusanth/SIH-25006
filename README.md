## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for Implementing Biosecurity Measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza (AI) and African Swine Fever (ASF) can cause severe economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods.

Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited regions—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms.

The portal must provide end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:
Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions
Interactive training modules and best-practice guidelines customized for pig and poultry farms
Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers progress toward disease-free compartment recognition
Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and potential biosecurity breaches
Multilingual and mobile-first design for accessibility in rural and remote regions

Additionally, the platform should support data collection and analytics for policy development, enable collaboration among farmers, veterinarians, and extension workers, and strengthen long-term biosecurity resilience in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

1)  Enhanced farmer awareness and education about biosecurity
2)  Improved farm-level risk management and self-assessment
3)  Easy access to customized, practical biosecurity guidelines
4)  Digital compliance tracking and record maintenance
5)  Timely alerts and disease notifications
6)  Healthier livestock and increased productivity
7)  Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources
8)  Better support for authorities through data-driven disease surveillance
9)  Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem
10) Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases

Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
We propose a low-cost, modular, AI-Enabled Track Monitoring System:
1) Which is a fully indigenous, Make-in-India track monitoring system built with local sensors and opensource software to reduce foreign dependency.
2) It delivers real-time precision, recording chainage data every 25 cm with ±2 mm accuracy for gauge,
   alignment, unevenness, rail wear, and sleeper health.
3} A multi-sensor approach enhances accuracy e.g: gauge is measured using both ToF sensors and
   stereo vision cameras, with similar redundancy applied across other parameters.
4) The system is battery-powered, ensuring portability and reliable use even in remote areas.
5) Its modular design supports easy upgrades from demo tracks to trains running at 200 km/h—by
   integrating industrial-grade sensors.
6) For validation, it includes multi-angle video capture to visually confirm detected defects.
7) With Edge AI processing, it fuses data, filters noise, detects defects instantly, and supports cloudready storage.
8) Finally, its open and customizable architecture ensures adaptability for the evolving needs of Indian
   Railways.

## Feasibility and Viability
1) Low-cost prototype → easily achievable with off-the-shelf components.
2) Scalable design → prototype → real-time high-speed TRC system for Indian Railways.
3) Technical expertise available through open-source libraries, AI models, and
  low-cost computing boards (e.g. Nvidia Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi)

## Impact and Benefits
## Impact:
Safety First: Early detection of track issues → prevents accidents,
saving lives.
Operational Efficiency: Less downtime for inspections → smoother
railway operations.
Indigenous Solution: Reduces dependence on costly foreign technology
## Benefits:
# Economic
       80% cost savings compared to imported TRCs.
       Reduces maintenance costs by predictive monitoring.
# Social
       Safer travel experience for millions of passengers.
       Supports Make-in-India and Digital India initiatives.
# Environmental
       Timely repairs → fewer derailments → less environmental damage.
       Energy-efficient system → low carbon footprint.
